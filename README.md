# Classical AI - A* algorithm
This program is implemented to find the route path for delivering route through multiple targets. By applying A* algorithm that represent as a classical AI.

## This program includes:
- Clarifying the problem.
- Implementing multiple heuristic functions.
- Analyse the shortest path vs the fastest path.
